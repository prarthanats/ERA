# Project Overview

This repository contains code and utilities for training and evaluating deep learning models, possibly for tasks like machine translation or other sequence-to-sequence tasks using the PyTorch framework.

## File Descriptions

- `lightning_module.py`: Contains code related to the PyTorch Lightning framework, including callback definitions.
- `train.py`: Core file for training the model. It handles dataset loading, model training, and utilities for progress tracking.
- `model.py`: Defines the neural network architectures, including custom layers and blocks.
- `dataset.py`: Handles dataset processing, specifically for bilingual datasets, which could be used in machine translation tasks.
- `config.py`: Provides configurations for the training process, including batch size, epochs, learning rate, and other essential parameters.
