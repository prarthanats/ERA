# Implementation of Digit Classification on MNIST Data using PyTorch

This repository is an implementation of training and testing code for digit classification on MNIST data using PyTorch.

## MNIST Data
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It is made up of a number of grayscale pictures that represent the digits 0 through 9. The collection contains square images that are each 28x28 pixels in size, for a total of 784 pixels per image.
